# Very Slow Movie Player - ESP8266 edition

This project is about building an e-Ink/e-Paper movie player.
Instead of showing 24 frames per seconds, it will be one frame per hour (or 24 frames per day) only.
It was inspired by [VSMP](vsmp) from Bryan Boyer.

The challenge: battery powered (no cables)

Components used:

 * Waveshare [7.5 inch e-Paper HAT](7in5)
 * Waveshare ESP8266 e-Paper driver board (for development)
 * [GxEPD2] Arduino Display Library for SPI E-Paper Displays

Current status: work in progress
